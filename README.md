# Taking Note of FiscalNote

## Overview and Origin

In 2013, FiscalNote began with Timothy Hwang, along with Gerald Yao and Jonathan Chen. They started this endeavor with the idea to change how businesses and organizations access and utilize government and policy data. They’ve done this in order to simplify and enhance the decision-making processes for business and organizations. 

According to the Seeking Alpha website: "FiscalNote is a government analytics platform that provides structured data on legislative bills to government agencies, businesses, trade groups, and non-profit agencies in over 80 countries." 

Personal anecdote incoming: I remember having a conversation with a CEO during the 2020 pandemic and elections later that year. When asked who he wanted to win the election that year he simply stated that it didn't really matter to him, but knowing the regime that would take over would help him know how to adjust some of his business strategies moving forward. He really just needed to know what rules to play by in the game. FiscalNote, to me, seems like a great resource to help business leaders to understand any new political ‘rules’ that might impact them.

After learning more about this space, it was fascinating to discover elements of the enormity of our government and the mountains of paperwork that are reviewed and approved throughout the legislative process. “Since World War II (the earliest we have data), Congress has typically enacted 4-6 million words of new law in each two-year Congress.” [See Source]https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/statistics Add into that global governments and it seems impossible to track and make sense of constantly updating policies and regulations. This is the main area, I believe, where FiscalNote is striving to be the problem-solver. Making sense of modern-day political developments, from the source, in real-time. According to the author of the article in Seeking Alpha, Sergio Heiber, the company "has the potential to become the Bloomberg equivalent in legislative data and capture the majority of Fortune 100 companies as customers."  Bloomberg is a large company that focuses on business and financial data, news, and insight. FiscalNote hopes to become similar in size. 

An interesting beginning to FiscalNote's funding was a cold email from Timothy Hwang to Mark Cuban, this got things started for the company. They then secured more subsequent investments from New Enterprise Associates, Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, and First Round Capital, this later round raised $1.3 million. Then more investments came along including a $7 million Series A round with contributions from Jerry Yang, Mark Cuban, Steve Case and others. In subsequent rounds, FiscalNote raised additional millions, including $10 million in a third round with investment from Chinese social network Renren. They continue to attract more investments as they are now an established and publicly-traded company in the microcap space. 


## Business Activities


Again from the Seeking Alpha article: "The company employs a Software as a Service ("SaaS") model and derives the majority of its revenue from subscriptions. It uses a land and expand strategy which is typical in the SaaS industry, beginning with a small contract for one product and adding additional services and products for each respective customer. Typically, starter contracts are in the $10-$15K per year range with some enterprises such as the U.S. Department of Defense ("DOD") expanding to several million dollars."


An interesting fact about FiscalNote is that its customers are every member of the U.S. Congress, 60 of the Fortune 100 companies, many of the U.S. federal government agencies, local, state and foreign governments, and non-profit organizations. Interestingly enough, they also have 17 patents! A deeper dive into their products shows they work in data analytics, information on government funding, supply chain updates and compliance requirements. Their main offering is what they call the "GRM" which is the Government Relationship product and it is also SOC2 Type 2 compliant which is extremely important when it comes to security. This also explains or justifies their ability to work with the Department of Defense which is believed to be their largest customer. 


## Landscape

FiscalNote operates in the field of policy and market intelligence. It's a technology company specializing in software as a service (SaaS), offering tools and platforms for comprehensive analysis and tracking of governmental and legislative data. Their services are particularly relevant for organizations needing insights into policy changes, regulatory compliance, and governmental affairs. This field combines aspects of legal, political, and data analysis, harnessing advanced technologies like AI and machine learning to provide actionable intelligence.


Over the last 5 to 10 years, the field of policy and market intelligence has seen major trends and innovations such as the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for data analysis, increased use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding complex legislative texts, and the rise of predictive analytics to forecast policy impacts. There's also been a growing emphasis on real-time data monitoring and the use of big data to provide comprehensive, actionable insights. These innovations have significantly enhanced the ability of businesses and organizations to navigate and respond to the rapidly changing policy landscape.




## Results

When you consider the clientele of FiscalNote it’s hard to quantify the impact their services are having on the world around us but obviously they are at least involved in much of the changes and adjustments that companies and organizations make around the world.  As legislation changes and evolves and impacts the public and private sectors, companies, organizations and lobbies use FiscalNote to respond accordingly. 

As the company has grown they’ve been able to purchase competitors like CQ Roll CAll (Congressional Quarterly), and others. I mentioned the comparisons to Bloomberg earlier in the case study but interestingly enough Bloomberg has another product called Bloomberg Government that is a competitor for them. Initially when I was looking for a company to focus on I thought of a friend of mine who works at a sizeable law firm and I learned that they have dedicated IT teams trying to help build out internal legal records and files to aid in their ability to develop and win cases, this would also include access to state and federal policies where it’s important for them to be aware of any changes that can happen in their world. 

## Recommendations

One of the criticisms or controversies regarding FiscalNote is the fact that their tool is viewed as “too expensive” by some and creates a more exclusive group of organizations that are able to use its resources. This was reported in an article in the MIT review, I can see applications that would be helpful for even individual citizens who would have an interest in being more up-to-date on their politics and legislature.
